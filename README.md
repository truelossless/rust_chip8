# rust_chip8
Yet another chip8 emulator written in Rust.  
This project was originally done in August 2019.  
Not all opcodes are supported; I only focused my efforts on making work 3 roms (which can be found under the roms folder).  
Thanks to https://github.com/dmatlack/chip8/tree/master/roms/games for the roms.  

## Launching the emulator

Opening a .ch8 with rust_chip8 should just work fine.  
However, you have a few interesting settings to play with if you use the CLI.
